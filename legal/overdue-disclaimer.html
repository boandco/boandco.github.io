<h2><sup>2.</sup> Late Payment Interest:</h2>

<h2><sup>7.</sup> Legal Action:</h2>
<p class="indent">If the Client fails to make payment within a reasonable period after receiving notification of overdue payment, the Company reserves the right to pursue legal action to recover the outstanding amount. The Client shall be responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by the Company in connection with such legal action.</p>

<h2><sup>8.</sup> Severability:</h2>
<p class="indent">If any provision of this Disclaimer is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
