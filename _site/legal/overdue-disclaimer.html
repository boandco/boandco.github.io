      <h1>Overdue Invoice Payment Disclaimer</h1>

<p>This disclaimer (the "Disclaimer") sets forth the terms and conditions regarding overdue invoice payments by the due date or 30 days after the invoice was issued. By engaging in business with Bo & Co, hereinafter referred to as the "Company," the recipient of this Disclaimer, hereinafter referred to as the "Client," acknowledges and agrees to the following:</p>

<h2><sup>1.</sup> Payment Terms:</h2>
<p class="indent">The Client agrees to make payment for all invoices issued by the Company within the specified due date or within 30 days from the date of invoice issuance, whichever comes later.</p>

<h2><sup>2.</sup> Late Payment Interest:</h2>
<p class="indent">In the event that the Client fails to make payment by the due date or within 30 days from the date of invoice issuance, the outstanding amount shall be subject to a monthly interest rate of 5% (the "Interest Rate"). The Interest Rate will be calculated on the outstanding balance from the due date or 30 days after the invoice was issued, until the date of full payment.</p>

<h2><sup>3.</sup> Accrued Interest:</h2>
<p class="indent">The Interest Rate will be applied on a monthly basis, compounding monthly until the outstanding balance is fully settled. The Client acknowledges and agrees to pay the accrued interest along with the principal amount.</p>

<h2><sup>4.</sup> Payment Allocation:</h2>
<p class="indent">Any payments received from the Client will be applied first towards the accrued interest, and subsequently towards the outstanding principal balance.</p>

<h2><sup>5.</sup> Notification of Overdue Payment:</h2>
<p class="indent">The Company reserves the right to send reminders and notifications to the Client regarding overdue payments. These notifications may be sent via email, mail, or any other reasonable means of communication.</p>

<h2><sup>6.</sup> Dispute Resolution:</h2>
<p class="indent">In the event of a dispute regarding the invoice or the amount owed, the Client shall promptly notify the Company in writing. The Company and the Client shall make reasonable efforts to resolve the dispute in good faith.</p>

<h2><sup>7.</sup> Legal Action:</h2>
<p class="indent">If the Client fails to make payment within a reasonable period after receiving notification of overdue payment, the Company reserves the right to pursue legal action to recover the outstanding amount. The Client shall be responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by the Company in connection with such legal action.</p>

<h2><sup>8.</sup> Severability:</h2>
<p class="indent">If any provision of this Disclaimer is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.</p>

<p>By continuing to engage in business with the Company, the Client acknowledges and agrees to the terms and conditions set forth in this Disclaimer regarding overdue invoice payments.</p>
